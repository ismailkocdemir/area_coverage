## area coverage
Aim is to cover all reachable position in a grid with obstacles placed randomly.
Algorithm, starting from a random position, calculates a path for the robot to visit all reachible positions in a greedy way.
Run the '''coverage.py''' to see how many steps, on average, the algorithm takes on a 5x5 grid.
